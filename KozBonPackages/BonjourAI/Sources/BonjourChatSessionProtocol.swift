    /// is only rendered once at least one real message exists, so the
    /// user saw nothing happen and reported the send button as broken.

    /// a way to seed transcript content without re-running it through
    /// the model. The user therefore sees their previous conversation
    /// rendered above the compose bar, but the model itself starts
    /// fresh on the next send. This is documented in the
    /// "Persist chat history" preference's footer.

    ///   order. An empty array is equivalent to ``reset()``.
